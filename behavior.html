		<p class="p-left">"In her essay “How Silicon Valley Sets Time,” sociology professor Judy Wajcman argues that the aims of time-tracking tools  and the demographic makeup of Silicon Valley are no coincidence. Silicon Valley’s elite workforce “is even younger, more masculine and more fully committed to working all hours,” while also creating productivity tools that are premised on a kind of ruthless, winner-takes-all race to maximal efficiency. This means that young, mostly male engineers, often unencumbered by time-consuming familial or community responsibilities, are building the tools that will police very different workplaces, quantifying the productivity and desirability of employees. The workaholism and round-the-clock hours often glorified by tech start-ups become an implicit benchmark against which other workers are measured, producing a vision of a standard worker that is masculinized, narrow, and reliant on the unpaid or underpaid care work of others."<span class="container-legend"><span class="legend">[reference:2]<span class="legend-1">Crawford, Kate. 2021 Atlas of AI: Power, Politics, and the Planetary Costs of Artificial Intelligence.

Workers began suffering high stress, Injuries, and illness. Muse explained that if their rate went down three times they would be fired, no matter how long they had worked at the warehouse. Workers talked about having to skip bathroom breaks for fear that they would underperform." <span class="container-legend"><span class="legend">[reference:2]<span class="legend-1">Crawford, Kate. 2021 Atlas of AI: Power, Politics, and the Planetary Costs of Artificial Intelligence.
